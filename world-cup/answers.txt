Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
    Brazil winning over Belgium.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
    after 10000 simulations the probability of each team winning becomes relatively static.
